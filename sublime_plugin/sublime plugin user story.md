## sublime plugin user story
user needs a plugin to be connected to a text editor so that he/she can see what is the code being written. So they need plugin for :

 - **recognizing what they say**
Their voice must be recognized and converted into the right code(python code format) as they say it.
  
 - **showing proper error if what they said was not like the explained rules format** 
 When they say something that was not defined, for example if they say *function  name* instead of *define name* an error must be shown.
  
 
 - **showing proper error if their voice was not recognized well**
 If they say something so fast or in a way that can't be recognized, it must show a proper error so user will understand what the problem is.

 
 - **seeing their converted code in text editor**
 The converted voice which is now a python code must be shown in an editor in a right format.
 - **running the code**
 They must be able to run their code to see the output.
