## **math operations**
When users want to declare a variable using math operations such as add, subtract, multiply and divide they have to say it in the following structure:

    variable {variable_name} is operation {operation_type} {variable_one type} {variable_one name/value} 
    {proper conjunction} {variable_two type} {variable_two name/value}
  
 **operation types and their  conjunction**
	 
|  operation type|operation  conjunction | 
|--|--|
| add | to |
| subtract | from |
| multiply | by  |
| divide| by  |

**variable types**

    variable(for dynamic variables)

    string
    
    list
    
    integer
    
    float

**Examples**

 - variable my  first var is operation add string my string to integer 2 

 we get this code:
	

	    my_first_var = "my string" + "2"
	 

 - variable my second var is operation multiply  float 2 point 3 by integer 4

 we get this code:
	

	    my_second_var = 2.3 * 2
- variable my  third var is operation subtract variable x from  integer 4

	we get this code:
	

	    my_third_var = 4 - x
- variable my  fourth var is operation divide variable my var by variable y

	we get this code:
	

	    my_forth_var = my_var / y
