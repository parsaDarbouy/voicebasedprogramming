# If Condition
### Overall Format:
In order to define ELSE condition in python, user has to say :
    `else condition`
    
In order to define any IF/ELIF condition in python, user has to say the following format:

    if/else if condition {type_of_the_variable} {name_of_the_variable} is {type_of_the_compare} {type_of_the_variable} {name_of_the_variable}
    
`{type_of_the_variable}` can be:
- `variable` for dynamic variables.
- `integer`
- `float`
- `string`

`{type_of_the_compare}` can be:
- `equal to`
- `not equal to`
- `less than`
- `greater than`
- `less than or equal to`
- `greater than or equal to`

for example:

    if condition variable temp number is equal to integer 22

and the code which will be generated is:

    if temp_number == 22:
