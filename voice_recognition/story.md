##Voice recognition user story

Is necessary to find the best engine that can convert human voice to text. For this matter we decided to find an offline engine.
The engine we ended up finding is called sphinx. 

Although the accuracy of the engine is not quit good yet, we're looking forward to enhance it soon. 

After a while we found out that the training process requires more resources hence we could not continue
down this path so we had to pivot to a new engine. we decided to go with google engine since its
accuracy is uncanny.

Now that we're using google in our engine, most of the methods should be removed since they have
no use anymore.
