##Line Commands

###Go to line

We are able to move the cursor at the beginning of any line. There are three ways to do that:

#### Move line to the beginning of the file:

```sh
Go to line start
```

#### Move line to the end of the file:

```sh
Go to line end
```

#### Move line to the beginning of a line:

```sh
Go to line [line number]
```

We can also remove any line we want:

```sh
Remove line [line number]
```
