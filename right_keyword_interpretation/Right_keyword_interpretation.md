# Right Keyword interpretation


We want to find the closest keyword to a word from set of keywords and replace it with that keyword.
so you get the word as input and if the program find a keyword close to it, it will return the keyword. otherwise the original word will return. this program use word's pronunciation to find the closest keyword.

#### example:

```sh
right_keyword("deth")
```
#### will return:
```sh
"def"
```
